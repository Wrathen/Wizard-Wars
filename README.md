# Wizard Wars
 Online 1v1 Wizard Wars Game made with Unity C#.

- This has been a simple recreation of what I did back in the day. The previous version was for Android phones and I had great times playing it with friends. But unfortunately I lost all source code and stuff. So, this one is nothing but a recreation.

- Also I will be providing the server in another repo.

- Most of the collisions are checked clientside and then sent to the server. Server just acts like a broadcaster at this point since I didn't feel the need to be implementing any protection/encryption or anything relating to that since I only planned this project to be played between me and my friends.

- I always wanted to make a bullet-hell like game, so this game is all about spamming spells.
